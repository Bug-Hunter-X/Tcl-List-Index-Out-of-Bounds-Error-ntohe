This repository showcases a common error in Tcl code: improper handling of list indices. The `bug.tcl` file contains code that demonstrates the issue, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  The original code fails to handle cases where the requested index is outside the bounds of the list. The solution adds explicit checks to prevent this.
